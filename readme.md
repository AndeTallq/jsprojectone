Javascript project one - The to-do list
    -I chose the to-do list as I found the recommendation interesting and challenging.

    -The build went rather smoothly 
    -I had some errors here and there but I was able to google solutions quickly. To me, it's important to understand why the solution works instead of just accepting it as a fact and pasting it into my code.

    -Features that I've implemented:
        -Checkbox with feedback when you check it.
        -Few different error messages.
        -Able to remove added items with X
        -Highlights when input is denied.
        -clear local storage button.
        -counter that shows the number of tasks
        -fun layout with keyframe animations

    -Issues
        -I tried to collect the values in the local storage for the longest time and append them to the main ul when the page was loaded up for the first time each session.
        -I was unfortunately unsuccessful with this and the listed items are only stored in the local storage but not shown in any way on the site itself.
